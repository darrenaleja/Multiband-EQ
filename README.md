1. Developed an offline equalizer with GUI capabilities, enabling users to select and apply audio effects to enhance audio files.
2. Utilized Butterworth low-pass, Chebyshev Type II band-pass, and high-pass filters to precisely control frequency bands and ensure high-quality audio output.
3. Integrated real-time adjustments, including preamp gain, reverb (using convolution with impulse responses), frequency shifts, and echo, simulating various audio environments.
4. Applied principles of digital signal processing to achieve a balance between smooth frequency roll-off and sharp band separation, enhancing the listening experience for users.

## Installation Process
1. For those who have MATLAB installed, please run and open the application using MATLAB App Designer.
2. For those who do not have access to MATLAB, please install MATLAB Compiler Runtime. This is free to download and allows the execution of compiled MATLAB applications without MATLAB. Run the executable there after to utilize the software.
